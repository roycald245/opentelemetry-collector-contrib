  Log records with no body are dropped by Splunk on reception
  as they contain no log message, albeit they may have attributes.
  
  This PR removes those logs from consideration to be exported.
  
  This is in tune with the behavior of splunkhecreceiver, which refuses HEC events with no event (#19769)
